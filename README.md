## \:information\_source: Known Limitation

Due to Chrome extension API restrictions, it's not possible to **fully detect tabs that have been automatically discarded (unloaded) by Chrome**. These tabs may still show a **‚ÄúDiscard‚Äù** button in the interface, even though they‚Äôre already inactive.

> Clicking ‚ÄúDiscard‚Äù again is harmless ‚Äî Chrome will silently ignore the request if the tab is already unloaded.


## \:hammer\_and\_wrench: Tech Stack

* Vanilla JavaScript
* Chrome Tabs API
* HTML, CSS


## \:sparkles: Credits

Inspired by Chrome's built-in tab discarding, but with a clean manual interface and better visibility.
